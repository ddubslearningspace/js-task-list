# js-task-list
 A simple To-Do app built in JavaScript ES6, using Materialize CSS. 
 
 The app was built following [Traversy Media's](https://traversymedia.com/) course. [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/), with my own optimizations and additions incorporated into the final product.

 My additions include:
 * Optimizing the JavaScript with a re-usable function to initialize/load variables from local storage.
 * Adding ID numbers to each task in the task list.
 * Adding a checkbox to each task to allow you to mark it complete/incomplete.
